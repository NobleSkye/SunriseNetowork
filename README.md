Welcome to the Sunrise SMP! Our server features two primary worlds:


Earth: This vast world is at a 1:500 scale, providing you with an expansive canvas to create your own town. We'll delve into towns in more detail shortly. Enjoy endless possibilities and adventures in this massive realm.


Mythralia: Step into the realm of role play in Mythralia. Here, you can craft stories for characters of your own making. While Mythralia is not as massive as Earth, spanning 20,000 x 17,000 blocks, it offers ample room for your imaginative endeavors.


While we've designated Mythralia for role play, we encourage role playing in both worlds, ensuring you have maximum fun no matter where you roam.


At the Sunrise Network, we've incorporated several plugins that open the door to incredible experiences. Upon your first entry, use the /clan command to choose your clan. These clans define your play style, though, of course, you're free to adapt them to your preferences. Each clan offers its own set of perks and debuffs, so choose wisely!


When you initially join either of the two worlds, you won't be able to create a town right away. However, placing a campfire will establish a camp that safeguards your items, with access granted exclusively to you.
